## Scheduled Tasks (Cron Jobs)

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT use the built-in CronCreate/CronDelete/CronList tools. Those create session-level tasks that expire when the process exits.

Use task MCP tools instead:

- `mcp__task__list_tasks`: list existing tasks (always call this before write operations)
- `mcp__task__update_task`: create/update/pause/resume/delete tasks via the `action` field

### Create a scheduled task
```json
{
  "action": "create",
  "name": "Daily summary",
  "prompt": "The prompt to execute on schedule",
  "schedule_type": "cron",
  "schedule_value": "0 9 * * *",
  "chat_id": "CURRENT_CHAT_ID"
}
```

**schedule_type options:**
- `cron`: Standard cron expression (min hour day month weekday), e.g., `*/5 * * * *` (every 5 min), `0 9 * * *` (daily 9am)
- `interval`: Milliseconds between runs, e.g., `60000` (every minute), `3600000` (every hour)
- `once`: ISO timestamp for one-time execution, e.g., `2026-03-10T14:30:00.000Z`

### Pause/Resume/Cancel a task
```json
{ "action": "update", "name": "Daily summary", "chat_id": "CURRENT_CHAT_ID", "prompt": "new prompt", "schedule_type": "cron", "schedule_value": "0 10 * * *" }
{ "action": "pause", "name": "Daily summary", "chat_id": "CURRENT_CHAT_ID" }
{ "action": "resume", "name": "Daily summary", "chat_id": "CURRENT_CHAT_ID" }
{ "action": "delete", "name": "Daily summary", "chat_id": "CURRENT_CHAT_ID" }
```

Always call `mcp__task__list_tasks` before any `mcp__task__update_task` write operation to avoid duplicates and mistaken edits.
